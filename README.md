Our Discord Bot named Soundify is a advanced discord music bot to get your vcs more active.

## Additional Information
Soundify runs on a private hosting server so the bot should be running 24/7, unless I am doing bug fixes and need to restart the bot, or something else happens that is out of my control. The bot is constantly updating, and with constant updates comes with it's downs, when I reboot Soundify, it takes about an average of 5 seconds maybe less to turn the bot off and do a restart, if a command doesn't work wait about 5 seconds and try the command again. More commands will be added soon, such as games and some miscellaneous commands I have in mind. As for right now I am just perfecting the current commands to make sure it doesn't have any bugs and issues. All the commands the fit for PG-13 audiences.

# Private Policy:
Soundify does **store** information. It stores guild ids and prefixes for each guild. We need this information because the bot will not work properly without the information. 

# Upcomming updates
The developers of Soundify will add a 24/7 command were the bot can stay in your vc 24/7. We will also add more commands related to music ofc. 

**To make it more clear as bot updates go on, any information and/or data that goes to Soundify will STORED. To delete the data please contact one of the developers in the support server immediately**
