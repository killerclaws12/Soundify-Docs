The bot MiningAway is a bot on Discord that is minecraft themed. It is a economy bot with minecraft commands such as chop, mine, and etc.
## Additional Information
MiningAway runs on a private hosting server so the bot should be running 24/7, unless I am doing bug fixes and need to restart the bot, or something else happens that is out of my control. The bot is constantly updating, and with constant updates comes with it's downs, when I reboot MiningAway, it takes about an average of 5 seconds maybe less to turn the bot off and do a restart, if a command doesn't work wait about 5 seconds and try the command again. More commands will be added soon, such as games and some miscellaneous commands I have in mind. As for right now I am just perfecting the current commands to make sure it doesn't have any bugs and issues. All the commands the fit for PG-13 audiences.
